# StaticCamera

Static Camera is an alternative ingame camera for Ballance where the camera always keeps the same distance/angle to the player ball (i.e. as if it has no inertia when chasing the player ball).

## Configs

- "Rotate Key": the key to rotate the static camera. Normally this should be set to the same as the key for rotating the normal ingame camera.
- "Left/Right Key": the key to be used together to decide the direction, when rotating the camera.
- "Sync Key": the key to synchronize the static camera with actual ingame camera. Default: `Right Shift`.
- "Alternative Key Checking": use the alternative way of checking key presses, useful in scenarios where normal inputs are blocked.

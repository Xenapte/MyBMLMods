# WindowSizeFixer

A mod for fixing your window size in windowed mode.

The original Ballance Player has a problem where the window size is slightly smaller than the actual display size in windowed mode so that the bottom-right portion of the display is clipped and must be manually resized to reveal.

This mod fixes the said problem by resizing the window to match its intended size and centering the resized window on startup.

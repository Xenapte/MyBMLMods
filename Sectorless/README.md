# Sectorless

A mod to make all modules in your map show up at the same time, regardless of their assigned sectors.

# Configs

- `Enabled` - whether to enable this mod.
- `RemoveCheckpoints` - whether to remove checkpoints. By default this mod pushes every module to the first sector so they are physicalized at once; they are therefore dephysicalized after the player reaches the next checkpoint. This option removes all checkpoints so dephysicalizations can't happen.
- ~~`Experimental_DuplicateModules`~~ - duplicate modules so they show up in every sector. Experimental, currently doesn't work.
